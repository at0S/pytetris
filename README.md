## What is this?
A follow-along for the pygame tutorial videos. This one is re-creating famous and classic Tetris game.

### Python
Running on Python 3.12.4, installed and managed via pyenv:
```bash
$ brew install pyenv
$ pyenv install 3.12.4
$ pyenv global 3.12.4
```
Poetry is used as a dependency manager:
```bash
$ pip install pipx
$ pipx install poetry
```

NOTE: I had the version of Poetry installed for Python 3.10.x and this did not like me switching to 3.12.4. Just fisted `poetry` in with
```bash
$ pip install --force poetry
```
Not big fan of that, but focus is in `pygame` and not on `poetry`.
